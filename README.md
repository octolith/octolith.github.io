My Personal Website
============
Welcome! This project showcases my personal website, where you can find information about me, my experience, and my work. It’s built using Angular and serves as a starting point if you’d like to create your own personal website. If you're interested, feel free to use this project or start with my [Angular Template For My Website](https://github.com/octolith/angular-template-my-website).

## Website Overview
The website opens with a header and main section (hero section) to catch attention right away, giving users easy access to my experience and contact options.

The main sections include:
- **Experience**: a timeline with a brief overview of my work history.
- **Projects**: cards showcasing my personal projects.
- **About Me**: a short description about me.
- **Contact**: various ways to reach me.

The footer contains the site icon, navigation links, and contact icons. The entire site is **responsive** and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Usage
To run the site locally, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. Then, install the dependencies with:<br />
`npm install`

Start the application with:<br />
`npm start`
